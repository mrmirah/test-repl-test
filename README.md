# Practice Quest: A New Beginning
**`Quest giver: Frost Limesprite`**
>Oh... I don't recognize you... hold on... ahem... WELCOME TRAVELER! It is not often that somebody passes my residence.  Now that I think of it, it has probably been around one year since I have last seen a traveler.  I will gladly help you test your new abilities.  Hmmm, yes, yes, I think you would be capable of handling this.  I hope you are good at making lists.

### Objectives required to complete

#### Objective 1 - Project Board
- Try to come up with a simple project board

It will be helpful to practice playing with project boards in situations like this practice quest before needing to do it for part of a grade.  Directions for creating a Project Board are below.

On GitHub, you will need to create a Project Board.  There will be a "Projects" tab at the top of your repository.  Click on this and set up a Project Board:

- Click the "Create a project button" (should be green)
	- Give the project a relevant name and description
	- Select the "Template" dropdown and choose "Automated Kanban"
		- this will be helpful with issues getting moved around automatically for us sometimes
	- Click create project
- Delete all the cards that are in the "To do" column
	- Click the ... on a specific card and select "Delete Note"

With the project board made, you will need to add some cards to the project.

- Click the + on the top of the "To do" column
	- Enter a note and hit add
		- our notes should be short messages about what needs to be completed


#### Objective 4 - Top List
- Create a class called `FreshBeginning`
    - make the class in the following location (-> denotes going to a sub-folder)
        - `src` -> `main` -> `java`
- Make a list of print statements of your top 10 favorite movies and/or shows (google if you can't think of 10)
	- add a commit after every three movies

Print statements are written as `System.out.println();`. In between the (), we place variables or words we wish to print.  When printing words we wrap them between ""; therefore the statement would look something like `System.out.println("Words that will appear on the console exactly as they are typed here");`
